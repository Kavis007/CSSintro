        <p>In a general sense the word perfume means any odor that is appealing. In a stricter sense, however, “perfume” refers to a fragrant fluid preparation that is used to provide a scent. The art of perfumery consists of extracting, blending, and preserving certain fragrant substances so that their scents can be released into the air at will. Perfumes are the products of intricate combinations of natural scents, synthetic chemicals, fixatives, and alcohol.

            The earliest form of perfume was incense, which gives off its odor when burned. (The word perfume is derived from the Latin per fumum, meaning “through smoke.”) The first liquid perfumes were prepared as long ago as 3500 bc. Today there are hundreds of perfumes. They are found in nearly all cosmetic and toiletry items. Perfumes provide fragrance in bath oils, soaps, deodorants, and face powders. They are used in paints and cleaning materials to help mask undesirable odors.Perfume is usually an alcoholic solution with 10 to 15 percent aromatic ingredients. These ingredients may be natural products of plant or animal origin, or they may be synthetic materials. Most high-quality perfumes owe their distinctive fragrances to aromatic, highly volatile plant substances called essential oils, which are obtained from certain herbs, flowers, leaves, stalks, roots, or fruits. There are hundreds of essential oils. Some of the most common are lavender, rosemary, patchouli, and sandalwood.

            Essential oils are most often isolated from the plant material by a process called steam distillation. Three different methods of steam distillation are practiced. In the oldest and simplest method a vessel containing water and the chopped or crushed plant material is heated by a direct flame, and the water vapor and volatile oil are recovered by a water-cooled condenser. This original method is being replaced by a process in which the plant material is suspended on a grid above the water level, and steam from a second vessel is introduced under the grid. The volatiles are condensed and the oil is separated. In the third process, a grid is heated to prevent condensation of steam so that dry distillation is achieved.</p>
